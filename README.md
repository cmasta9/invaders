# invaders
My first game made with three.js

npm install -> npm start

The game is completely playable at this time, but may still be updated.

Click and drag or use the arrow keys to rotate the camera. Double-click to shoot a low-poly bomb at the aliens. Don't let them eat you!

Now also mobile-friendly :)
